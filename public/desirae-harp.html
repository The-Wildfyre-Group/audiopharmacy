                <!-- news body -->
                <p>“My mother used to sing to me in the womb, and when I was born the only thing that would soothe me was music.  As soon as I was able to speak, I also began to sing.  It became my main form of self-expression.”</p>
 
                <p>The phenomenal hummingbird, Native songstress – Desirae Harp is a Native California (Wappo) and Diné singer, poet, college student and community activist who grew up in Santa Rosa, California. Considered a child prodigy by her community at a very early age, Desirae has been sharing her beautiful and powerful voice with a wide range of audiences since the age of two. By the age of three, Desirae competed, performed and won various talent shows with hundreds of people in attendance.  At ten, she was approached by tribal elder Dennis Barela, who taught Desiraeindigenous songs and invited  to sing at ceremonies.  And at eleven, realizing Desirae’s passion and talent, her family and community came together to sponsor opera singing lessons which would elevate her capacity as a singer way beyond her expectations.</p>
 
                <p>Desirae’s greatest musical influences growing up were the Fugeesand Ulali. As a singer, Desirae wanted to fuse rhythm and blues, like the Fugees, and sing in her indigenous language like Ulali. Learning how to speak and sing in her indigenous language was a big milestone, and getting in touch with her indigenous culture also helped Desirae find her voice as a writer. As writer, Desirae would speak to herself through the songs that she would create.  She wrote lyrics that inspired her to be strong and to positively deal with the challenges she faced growing up as a Native youth. </p>
                
                <p>Though she had been writing songs since was a little girl, but it was not until Desirae started singing with Audiopharmacy that she began to gain confidence in to become a professional singer and realized how she could use music as a tool for social change. Desirae now uses her voice to advocate for the healing of Mother earth and her community.  Desirae also empowers others through teaching them how to use their voice, and has giving workshops to youth in afterschool programs teaching them how to sing and tell their own stories.</p>
