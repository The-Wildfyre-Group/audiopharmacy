                <h1>Ras Kwome</h1>
                <!-- news body -->
                <p>Legacy – to Kwome Gustave, this is where the passion behind the music comes from.  Born in 1980 into a family where music was as essential to life as food, water, air, and spirituality. Ras Kwome learned early that his destiny was to continue the musical work that his father, Ras Ibeshee, began with one of the most treasured bands from the US Virgin Islands – The Zioneers.</p>

                    Playing drums at an early age, he worked hard to emulate Carlton Barret – the drummer for Bob Marley & the Wailers.  In a few years, Ras Kwome’s skills became apparent to his father, who then groomed him to become a future member of the band.  At the age of 15, Ras Kwomebegan his professional career as the drummer for the Zioneers with the skill and good vibes of a seasoned veteran.  Together with his father, they held down the band's foundation of drum and bass alongside multi-instrumentalist and singer Ras Ibednego and keyboardist Sonny Andrews.  The combination gave the group the versatility and heartfulness that made The Zioneers one of reggae's premier bands. With the Zioneers, Ras Kwome has toured Puerto Rico, New Orleans, Chicago, California, North Carolina, Boston, Virginia, Florida, and Hawaii.

                    In 2006, the future of the Zioneers changed when RasIbeshee experienced a stroke.  With his father needing time to heal, Ras Kwome became a free-lance drummer playing with reggae all-stars like Bunny Wailer, Batch, RasAttitude, Queen Omega Chezidek, and Pato Banton among others.  Thankful for the all the opportunities that came his way, but still longing to continue to the legacy of the Zioneers, Ras Kwome, wanted his drumming to be a part of something that reflected his long-term goals as a musician – family.
