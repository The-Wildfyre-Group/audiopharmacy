                <p>Ras K’dee (VOCALS & KEYS), from San Francisco, California, is a Native
				California (Pomo)/	African musician, community educator, and renowned lyricist, producer, & lead vocalist/keyboardist for San Francisco-based live world hip-hop ensemble, Audiopharmacy. For K’dee, his musical inspiration is deeply rooted from his experienceas a Pomo/African artist. Translating artistically through hip-hop rhymes and soulful melodies, K’dee invokes the songs and dances from traditional ceremonies of his native people, and tells stories of resistance, healing, community & empowerment that can be understood and felt universally by all people. He has been compared to the likes of Gil Scott Heron, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Franti. Ras K’dee’s musical repetoire includes “Street Prison” (2005), which was awarded by East Bay Express as Best Local Album of The Year in 2006, co-production on Audiopharmacy album, “U Forgot About Us” (2009), and producing his first solo-project, “Cloudwriter” (2011). K’dee has also had his hand in releasing, producing, and engineering 16 LP albums by local and international artists and has shared the stage with Arrested Development, Dead Prez, Michael Franti, Pharcyde, X-Clan, Bruno Mars, Goapale and many more huge influences on his own music. K’dee has toured locally and internationally with Audiopharmacy for 9 consecutive years, traveling to Germany, Austria, UK, Holland, Switzerland, France, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and most recently to Morocco, Oman and Cyprus to share his music.

                <p>In 2003, K’dee co-founded (and is the current director) of a Native
				youth media organization Seventh Native American Generation (SNAG). K’dee leads workshops
				weekly with Youth and co-hosts the radio program “Bay Native Circle” on 94.1 FM in Northern California. K’dee has also been featured in Smithsonian Magazine (Summer 2010) and his awards include KQED American Indian Local Heroes Award (2009), and Most Earnest and Up And

                <p>Teao is a collector and connoisseur of music. </p>

                <p>Since 2001 when he produced "when the disease becomes the antidote" heads in the Bay Area music scene took note of Teao's organic approach. </p>

                <p>5 years later, the next two projects were released ; "Spare Change," followed by "U Forgot About Us." Both projects showed progression and an obvious momentum towards positive global impact.</p>

                <p>"Spare change," was produced solely by Teao n' Offerings. A year later, "U Forgot About Us," was a duo effort with fellow band mate Ras K dee. The momentum continues with "state of the heart," the live album.</p>

                <p>Teao has just completed his first solo project titled "Moment", a world-hip hop experiment, "the soundtrack to the seasons of life," explains Teao while rearranging his studio. </p>

                <p>As he searches for the auxiliary cord to play me a song from it, I eagerly await.
