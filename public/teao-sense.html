                <h1>Teao Sense</h1>
                <!-- news body -->
                <p>While Teao maintains the alias, "Dj Offerings" when rockin for crowds off of the turntables, Producer- Teao, IS "Dj Offerings," they are one of the same. Teao's name and the band Audiopharmacy are also synonymous, because as founder of the collective, it is this man who has kept the blood flowing from the start. In his room spending hours on edits that only a trained ear can differentiate, Teao pays a meticulous attention to detail.</p>
                
                <p>The Audiopharmacy name wouldn't have such a reputation without his effortless use of worldly instruments fused with turntablism. In his room parallel to the window overlooking San Francisco hangs a Zeung from China, leaning against a Sarod from India.</p>

                <p>Teao is a collector and connoisseur of music. </p>

                <p>Since 2001 when he produced "when the disease becomes the antidote" heads in the Bay Area music scene took note of Teao's organic approach. </p>

                <p>5 years later, the next two projects were released ; "Spare Change," followed by "U Forgot About Us." Both projects showed progression and an obvious momentum towards positive global impact.</p>

                <p>"Spare change," was produced solely by Teao n' Offerings. A year later, "U Forgot About Us," was a duo effort with fellow band mate Ras K dee. The momentum continues with "state of the heart," the live album.</p>

                <p>Teao has just completed his first solo project titled "Moment", a world-hip hop experiment, "the soundtrack to the seasons of life," explains Teao while rearranging his studio. </p>

                <p>As he searches for the auxiliary cord to play me a song from it, I eagerly await.
